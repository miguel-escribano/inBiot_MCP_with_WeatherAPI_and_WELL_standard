# InBiot Virus Resistance Indicator

**Source:** https://www.inbiot.es/wikinbiot/virus-spread-resistance-indicator

## Overview

The Virus Resistance Indicator (0-100) evaluates environmental conditions that affect the survival and transmission of airborne viruses, particularly focusing on respiratory pathogens.

## Key Factors Considered

- **Relative Humidity** - Critical factor in virus survival and transmission
- **Temperature** - Affects virus stability and human immune response
- **Air Quality Parameters** - Overall environmental conditions

## Scientific Basis

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Optimal Humidity (40-60% RH) | Reduces virus transmission significantly |
| Temperature Effects | Moderate temperatures support immune function |
| Air Circulation | Proper ventilation reduces airborne pathogen concentration |

## Score Interpretation

| Score | Level | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 80-100 | High Resistance | Conditions significantly reduce virus transmission risk |
| 60-79 | Good Resistance | Favorable conditions for reducing virus spread |
| 40-59 | Moderate Resistance | Some protective environmental factors present |
| 20-39 | Low Resistance | Conditions may favor virus survival and transmission |
| 0-19 | Very Low Resistance | Environmental conditions may enhance virus transmission |

## Health Implications

- Higher scores indicate better protection against airborne pathogens
- Low scores suggest increased risk of respiratory illness transmission
- Particularly important in high-occupancy spaces like offices, schools, and healthcare facilities

## Improvement Strategies

1. Maintain humidity between 40-60%
2. Ensure adequate ventilation (low CO₂ levels)
3. Monitor temperature for comfort and immune support
4. Consider air filtration improvements
5. Increase outdoor air intake when outdoor conditions permit
