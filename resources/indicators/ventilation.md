# InBiot Ventilation Efficiency Indicator

**Source:** https://www.inbiot.es/wikinbiot/ventilation-efficiency-indicator

## Overview

The Ventilation Efficiency Indicator (0-100) measures how effectively fresh air is being introduced and circulated throughout an indoor space.

## Primary Measurement Parameters

- **CO₂ Concentration** - Primary indicator of ventilation adequacy
- **Air Exchange Rates** - How frequently indoor air is replaced
- **Pollutant Removal** - Effectiveness at removing indoor contaminants

## CO₂ as a Ventilation Proxy

| CO₂ Level | Ventilation Quality |
|-----------|---------------------|
| < 400 ppm | Excellent (outdoor air quality) |
| 400-800 ppm | Good ventilation |
| 800-1000 ppm | Adequate for most spaces |
| 1000-1500 ppm | Poor - action needed |
| > 1500 ppm | Very poor - immediate attention |

## Score Interpretation

| Score | Level | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 80-100 | Excellent | Optimal air exchange and freshness |
| 60-79 | Good | Adequate fresh air supply |
| 40-59 | Acceptable | May need monitoring or improvement |
| 20-39 | Poor | Insufficient fresh air, stuffiness likely |
| 0-19 | Very Poor | Critical air quality issues |

## Health & Performance Impacts

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| Cognitive Function | Higher CO₂ levels reduce decision-making ability |
| Comfort | Poor ventilation leads to stuffiness and discomfort |
| Indoor Pollutants | Inadequate ventilation allows buildup of harmful substances |
| Infection Risk | Poor ventilation increases transmission of airborne illnesses |

## Improvement Actions

1. Increase outdoor air intake rates
2. Check and maintain HVAC systems
3. Ensure proper air distribution throughout space
4. Monitor CO₂ levels as a ventilation indicator
5. Consider demand-controlled ventilation systems
6. Open windows when outdoor air quality permits
