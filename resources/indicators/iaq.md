## Overview

The Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) Indicator (0-100) is a comprehensive composite index that evaluates overall air quality by combining multiple environmental parameters.

## Parameters Included

- **Chemical Pollutants**: VOCs, formaldehyde, CO, NO₂, O₃
- **Particulate Matter**: PM1, PM2.5, PM4, PM10
- **Basic Parameters**: CO₂, temperature, humidity
- **Ventilation Effectiveness**: Air circulation and exchange

## Calculation Method

The IAQ indicator uses a weighted algorithm that considers:
- Individual parameter concentrations vs. health standards
- Synergistic effects between different pollutants
- Overall environmental balance for human health

## Score Interpretation

| Score | Level | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 80-100 | Excellent | Optimal conditions for health and productivity |
| 60-79 | Good | Minor concerns, generally healthy environment |
| 40-59 | Acceptable | Some pollutants present, monitoring recommended |
| 20-39 | Poor | Multiple issues present, action needed |
| 0-19 | Very Poor | Significant health risks, immediate intervention required |

## Health Impact Assessment

**High IAQ scores** correlate with:
- Reduced respiratory symptoms
- Better cognitive performance
- Lower sick building syndrome complaints
- Enhanced overall wellbeing

**Low IAQ scores** may indicate:
- Elevated health risks for sensitive individuals
- Potential for respiratory irritation
- Reduced productivity and comfort
- Need for air quality intervention

## Improvement Strategies

1. **Source Control**: Reduce emissions from materials and activities
2. **Ventilation**: Increase fresh air intake and circulation
3. **Air Filtration**: Use appropriate filters for particulate removal
4. **Humidity Control**: Maintain optimal moisture levels
5. **Regular Monitoring**: Track trends and identify issues early
