## Integration Guidance

- Use these thresholds as **secondary validation** for WELL v2 feature analyses.  
- When the InBiot API returns values, compare them both to **WELL** and **ASHRAE / ISO** references.  
- Report like:  
  > "CO2 = 850 ppm → ✅ Compliant (WELL A03 & ASHRAE 62.1 within range)."  
- If values exceed these, output remediation guidance (e.g., increase ventilation rate, check filter maintenance).  
- Always cite: "Reference — ASHRAE 62.1-2022, ASHRAE 55-2020, ISO 16000 series, WHO 2021."
